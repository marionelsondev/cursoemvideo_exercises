Create a program that reads any phrase and tells if it's a palindrome, ignoring spaces.

Examples of palindromes:

"A man a plan a canal Panama"

Reasoning:

1. Read a phrase. -
2. Format the phrase without spaces and in all uppercase. -
3. Use the for loop to reverse the phrase. -
4. Compare the normal phrase with the reversed phrase to check if it's a palindrome. -
5. Display the result to the user. -
